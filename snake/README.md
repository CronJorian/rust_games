# Snake

The basegame is reveloped by using [this tutorial](https://mbuffett.com/posts/bevy-snake-tutorial/).

## Installation

Due to the compiled release being not published, [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) is required to run the game.

Run `cargo run --release` or `cargo build --release` in the `snake` directory (same level as this readme).
If you use the build option, the executable can be found under `./target/release/snake`.

## Usage

You can move the snake with the arrow keys or WASD. If you want to quit the game it can be done with the Escape button.
